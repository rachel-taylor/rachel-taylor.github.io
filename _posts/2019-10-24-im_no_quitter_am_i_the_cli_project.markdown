Frustration. Confusion. Glee.

When I started my project I was already two weeks behind. Where to start first? Every idea that I had come up with, I couldn't figure out a real world application for. Was a real world application what I was looking for? I wanted to reach out to all of my classmates and ask what their project was about, but I can see the appeal of *not* telling someone. 

Frustration seems to be the intial emotion quite frequently. I'm quickly coming to terms with not being able to remember everything spur of the moment. So where am I? No topic. No code. A blank text editor. What now? I went through several topics in my head, hoping that one of them made sense to me and sounded interesting. I ended up with three different repositories because as I started one; another, better topic came along. 

 I wanted it to be about gaming or medical; I figured if I was doing something I was interested in, the frustration would melt away. It sort of did? Creating the gem was easy thanks to Ruby's "magical ways". Now I had a title, a skeleton of what I needed; so now I just needed to make the code. Confusion. Where to start? Duh! I utilized previous lessons and videos to help flesh out what I thought I needed. I learned quickly how to interpret where my errors were telling me to go, not quite so quick at fixing it.
 
 There were so many bumps in the road trying to get this completed.


Glee! Guys! I made a thing! Eventually I'm going to have to use far more technical language than 'thething'. Which is likely soon because of the review! Even though it's felt like this entire project has lasted a lifetime because of everything going on, even though I wanted to quit so many times; nothing was better than seeing the correct text populate on the screen perfectly.
