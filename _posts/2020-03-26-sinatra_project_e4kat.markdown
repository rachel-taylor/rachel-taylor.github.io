Sinatra...I barely knew her. 

We had to create a project using Sinatra. I took that oppurtunity to create an app called Everything For Kids Academic Tutoring. Thanks to a friends tutoring service that she offers to children and adults alike, it gave my project guidance and focus. My main goal when starting this project would be for her to have a place to view the appointments that were created, and keep on a schedule for easy viewing. Currently the project is rather basic in that only appointments can be created, but soon she will have a fully functional app to assist in her business. 

As much as I feel like I know, that also feels like how much I don't actually know. Imposter syndrome is certainly real.
