Sinatra...I barely knew her. 

To get started we had to create a project using CRUD and MVC functionality. I took that oppurtunity to create an app for a friend called Everything For Kids Academic Tutoring. My main goal when starting this project was to create a more helpful approach to the scheduling process for families. 

  
>The [Corneal Gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/corneal) lays almost everything out that you need, barring any unforseen environment issues. You then have to build out your models, views, and controllers so that they all blend seamlessly.

 I made my site which allowed users to sign up and login as they chose, but something was wrong. Other users could also sign up with the same username and password combination. That doesn't work does it? That means your information isn't secure because I didn't provide *insert drum roll*   uniqueness. 
 
Uniquness is a value that must be set within the correct model. Once this is enabled your users cannot use the same email/password combination as someone else. 


As much as I feel like I know, that also feels like how much I don't actually know. Imposter syndrome is certainly real.
