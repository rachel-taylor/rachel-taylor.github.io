My rails project is currently the base app for what will be a crowd resource to aid in national disasters. Going into this project I was apprehensive and a little worried but I found that I learned quite a bit. 

Completing this project there were a lot of but what is the syntax for this questions. Utilizing the active record ruby guide will be your lifeline. 

Every if does not need an else. If you are like me as soon as you write if, you follow it up with else. This project taught me that if statements can exist without the else. If you're forcing to fit it in, just give it up ;-)

There is a lot more that will be added to this project as my learning path continues, but for now I am happy with it's basic function.
