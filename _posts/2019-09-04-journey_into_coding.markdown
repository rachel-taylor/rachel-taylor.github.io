Excitement. Frustration. Excitement.

On any given day learning to code, I experience a range of emotions, and a range of thoughts. Should I quit? Will I ever understand this? Was this the right thing for me to do?

Excitment; because I'm starting something that will change my life, and help me learn a new skill. Frustration; when I am debugging and cannot pinpoint where the error is coming from. Excitement; after a few looks at it, and maybe a mini break, I find that error, and I manage to fix it. More excitment because I've passed my test and can move onto the next lesson.

What then? I move onto the next lesson knowing that it might get frustrating, but I'm too legit to quit(ha). I stand and I face the monster, and I win, at least until the next error.

Week 3 and I feel like things are getting easier. I feel like I know what my error codes want me to do.  I still don't understand sometimes how I manage to get something working. Thanks to Flatiron, what I do know is that I don't have to cover this journey alone. I've met an incredible group of people who ensure that we leave no one behind. It's a family, and I can't wait to see what our next puzzle gives us.
